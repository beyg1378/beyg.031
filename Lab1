System Specification Sheet

Processor (CPU): 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1165G7 @ 2.80GHz, 4 Cores, 8 Logical Processors

RAM: 16 GB (likely DDR4, based on typical configuration for this CPU)

Storage: NVMe Micron_2210 SSD, 1 TB capacity

Operating System: Windows 11 Home

Analysis Questions

Based on your CPU cores, how many tasks can your processor theoretically handle simultaneously?

The CPU has 4 physical cores and 8 logical processors (via Hyper-Threading). This means it can theoretically handle up to 8 tasks simultaneously.

Is your storage primarily HDD or SSD? What are the performance implications?

The system uses an NVMe SSD. Compared to HDDs, SSDs provide much faster data access speeds, reduced boot times, quicker application loading, and improved overall responsiveness.

How does your RAM amount compare to typical requirements for modern applications?

With 16 GB of RAM, this system is well above the minimum requirements for modern applications. Most everyday use (browsing, office apps, streaming) requires 4‚Äì8 GB, while gaming, development, and multitasking typically recommend 16 GB. This amount allows smooth multitasking and good performance in modern workloads.

Exercise 2 (Optional): Operating System Feature Hunt

Process Management:

Running processes: system, system interrupts, wsappx, user manager, task scheduler

Highest CPU usage: Service Host: Windows Update

Memory Management:

Total RAM: 16 GB

Application using the most memory: (from Task Manager at the time) ‚Äì Windows background services

Free memory: Available in Task Manager (varies with usage)

File System Management:

Created folder OS_Lab_Test in Documents

Checked folder properties ‚Üí creation date: Friday, September 5, 2025, 7:53:30 PM

Device Management:

Devices found: Bluetooth device, Wi-Fi adapter, Ethernet adapter

Example installed driver: Intel Iris Xe Graphics driver

Security Features:

Windows Defender running

Automatic updates enabled

Recent security scans visible in Windows Security

Challenge Questions:

Which process is using the most resources and why might that be?

Windows Update was using the most resources. This happens because updates involve downloading, installing, and configuring system files, which is CPU- and disk-intensive.

What would happen if your OS didn‚Äôt manage memory automatically?

Applications could overwrite each other‚Äôs data, cause frequent crashes, or make the system unusable. Automatic memory management ensures efficient allocation and prevents conflicts.

How does your OS protect you from security threats?

Windows Defender runs real-time protection, scans for malware, and blocks suspicious files. Automatic updates patch vulnerabilities quickly, and built-in firewalls add another security layer.

‚úÖ This format covers all required parts (spec sheet + analysis for Exercise 1). Exercise 2 is optional, but I included it since you already gathered the info.

Do you want me to save this into a .docx file (ready to upload), or just keep it as text so you can paste it directly into Blackboard?

Exercise 1: System Hardware Detective

System Specs

CPU: Intel Core i7-1165G7, 11th Gen, 4 cores, 8 threads, base speed 2.8 GHz

RAM: 16 GB DDR4

Storage: 1 TB NVMe SSD (Micron 2210)

Operating System: Windows 11 Home

Analysis

My processor has 4 physical cores and 8 logical processors. This means it can handle up to 8 tasks at the same time in theory, which helps with multitasking.

My main drive is an SSD, not an HDD. SSDs are much faster, so my computer boots up quickly and programs open faster compared to systems with regular hard drives.

I have 16 GB of RAM, which is more than enough for most modern applications. Everyday tasks usually need 4‚Äì8 GB, so with 16 GB I can run heavier apps or multiple programs at once without problems.

Exercise 2: Operating System Feature Hunt (Optional)

Process Management

Some running processes I found: system, system interrupts, wsappx, user manager, and task scheduler.

The process using the most CPU at the time was ‚ÄúService Host: Windows Update.‚Äù

Memory Management

Total RAM is 16 GB.

Background services were using the most memory when I checked.

There was still free memory available for other apps.

File System Management

I made a new folder called OS_Lab_Test inside my Documents.

The folder showed the creation date as September 5, 2025, 7:53 PM.

Device Management

I found hardware like my Bluetooth device, Wi-Fi adapter, and Ethernet adapter.

One of the installed drivers is the Intel Iris Xe graphics driver.

Security Features

Windows Defender was active on my system.

Automatic updates are turned on.

I also saw that a recent security scan had been done.

Challenge Questions

The Windows Update process was using the most resources. That makes sense because updates involve downloading and installing files, which takes CPU and disk activity.

If the OS didn‚Äôt handle memory, programs could crash or interfere with each other since there wouldn‚Äôt be proper control over how memory is shared.

My OS protects me through real-time antivirus scanning, automatic updates to patch security holes, and built-in tools like the firewall.
